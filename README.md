Open Platform Site
==================

The Open Platform is a suite of services for developing products and applications with the Guardian. Build on top of the same platform that powers [theguardian.com] (http://theguardian.com/), and integrate your application with our journalism.

Currently, the Open Platform is comprised of only one service, the Content API.

Instructions for building the component parts of the site are contained within their respective Readmes.
